## M3.101 — active — 2026-09-25

- Branch: `fix/m3-101-integer-clip-times`.
- Scope: require persisted clip `timelineStartMs`, `sourceStartMs`, and non-null `sourceEndMs` values to be non-negative integer milliseconds.
- `sourceEndMs: null` remains valid for unknown source duration.
- M3.100 completed and squash-merged as PR #115 at `a6d9d8ee5d5f3782bd5de22ac61c2a3b5122218d`.
- Awaiting local validation of M3.101.
- PR #76 remains parked; PR #22 remains unrelated and untouched.

## Workflow for next chat

- Inspect actual `main` SHA, branch state, and open PRs before acting.
- M3.101 is the active milestone; do not assume local validation has passed.
- When user reports `PASS` / `pass` / `lanjutkan`, mark the active Draft PR ready, squash-merge it using the verified head SHA, record the actual merge SHA, reconcile all three docs, verify `main`, then audit and start the next focused milestone.
- Never claim lint/test/build/cargo/manual validation passed unless the user explicitly confirms it.


## M3.99 — completed — 2026-09-25

- Branch: `fix/m3-99-integer-audio-keyframe-times`.
- PR #114; squash-merged at `2918b809edf39306e15fdf884ce11ae3558fee7f`.
- Persisted Audio Volume Automation keyframe `timeMs` values now require integer milliseconds.
- Persistence aligns with runtime normalization, which rounds timestamps before ordering/deduplication.
- User reported PASS.
- No project schema version change and no change to canonical runtime/editor/preview/export behavior.
- PR #76 remains parked; PR #22 remains unrelated and untouched.
