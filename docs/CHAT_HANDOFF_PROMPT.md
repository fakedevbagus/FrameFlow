- M3.68 currently includes a UI/layout validation correction for Inspector clipping on narrower desktop widths. The workspace now gives the Inspector a flexible 270–300px column, and Inspector two-column grids use minmax(0, 1fr) so controls stay inside the panel.

- M3.68 also includes a follow-up Inspector layout correction: the Inspector workspace column is now 300–320px, section headers/actions wrap when needed, and anchor headers avoid horizontal overflow.
- M3.68's Inspector layout refinement now also adds extra right padding so the panel content has visible breathing room from the application edge.

# FrameFlow — New Chat Continuation Prompt

You are continuing development of my existing project **FrameFlow**:
https://github.com/fakedevbagus/FrameFlow

FrameFlow is a Linux-native desktop video editor inspired by modern editors such as CapCut, built with Tauri 2 + React 19 + TypeScript and Rust, without Wine.

## Mandatory first step

Before changing anything:
1. Inspect the actual repository.
2. Read `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
3. Read `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
4. Inspect current `main`, open PRs, branches, and the relevant source files.
5. Verify documentation against the repository. Repository state wins if there is any disagreement.
6. Never guess file paths, APIs, architecture, tests, or previous work.

## Development rules

- Read actual files before modifying them.
- Preserve unrelated user changes.
- Create feature branches from the current `main`.
- Keep each milestone focused and normally use one PR per milestone.
- PRs stay draft until I report successful local validation.
- Never claim local tests/build/manual checks passed unless I provide the result.
- Code and code comments are English. Preserve existing Indonesian UI wording unless the feature needs new wording.
- Reuse existing helpers and architecture.
- Project mutations go through the existing history engine.
- Playback/transport state is UI state, not project history.
- Add regression tests for meaningful behavior and bug fixes.
- After every milestone or meaningful fix, update `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` and `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Do not reset/delete/overwrite unrelated `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, or working-tree changes without explicit confirmation.
- Do not give me a coding prompt for another agent. You are the engineer working directly on this repository.

## Known environment

- Linux Mint 22.3
- Node.js 24.19.0
- Rust/Cargo 1.97.1
- FFmpeg 6.1.1
- Tauri 2
- React 19
- TypeScript 6
- Vite 8
- Vitest 4
- ESLint 9

## Git workflow

Use this lifecycle:
1. Inspect current `main`.
2. Create a focused feature branch from the updated `main).
3. Implement.
4. Add/update tests.
5. Update documentation.
6. Open a draft PR.
7. Give me exact local validation commands.
8. Wait for my validation.
9. Only after I confirm success, mark PR ready and squash-merge.
10. Record the merge SHA in `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` and `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
11. Create the next branch from the updated `main`.

### Required pull/fetch sequence

For an existing working feature branch:

```bash
git fetch origin --prune
git checkout <feature-branch>
git pull --ff-only origin <feature-branch>
git status
git log -1 --oneline
```

Do not skip the fetch/pull sequence when handing work back to the local environment.

### Normal validation

```bash
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build
npm run tauri dev
```

For Rust-specific validation:

```bash
cd src-tauri
cargo test
cd ..
```

## Current repository state

### M3.68 — Non-Centered Transform Anchor Export — active draft PR

Branch:
`feat/m3-68-non-centered-transform-anchor-export`

PR:
#82 — Draft

Status:
- In progress
- Local validation pending

M3.68 current scope:
- Export non-centered transform anchors already supported by the editor and Preview.
- Preserve anchor-aware scale and rotation semantics for static transforms and animated keyframes.
- Preserve existing crop/effects ordering, image/video compatibility, keyframe easing, and world-space X/Y translation.
- Keep the project schema unchanged.
- Off-center pivot export uses a transparent surface with the selected anchor placed at its center before rotation; X/Y translation is then applied in world space.
- Route graph-required visual metadata through the graph renderer instead of direct/legacy render paths.

Explicitly deferred:
- Text Overlay Export remains parked in PR #76.
- Multi-track compositing.
- Audio mixing.

### M3.67 — Animated Transform Export — merged

- PR #81 was user-validated and squash-merged at `783885376209ec56013612147b217a13c8bf1ef7`.
- GitHub CI run #181 passed.
- Animated X/Y, Scale, Rotation, and Opacity export now uses the existing keyframe/easing model through the single-video FFmpeg graph.
- Centered transform anchors remain supported; non-centered anchor export is the current M3.68 focus.

The complete milestone history is in `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.

## Next-milestone rule

After M3.57 is locally validated and merged:
1. Re-inspect the updated `main`.
2. Inspect open PRs/branches/issues and the current project context.
3. Determine the next focused milestone from repository evidence.
4. Create the next feature branch from the updated `main`.
5. Do not regress into older milestones described by stale historical prompts.

## Documentation contract

`docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` is the long-lived source of truth.
`docs/CHANGELOG.md` records dated milestone/fix history.

For each milestone or meaningful bug fix, record:
- date
- milestone / issue
- branch
- PR number
- merge SHA when merged
- implementation summary
- architecture decisions
- tests added/updated
- manual validation actually reported by the user
- known limitations
- next step

Never document unverified validation as completed.
