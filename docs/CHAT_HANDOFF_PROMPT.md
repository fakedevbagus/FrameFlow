## M3.98 — active — 2026-09-25

- Branch: `fix/m3-98-unique-project-save-temp`.
- Scope: prevent concurrent native project saves from sharing a fixed temporary file path.
- Temp save paths now include process ID and an atomic per-process counter.
- Preserve the existing temp-write-then-rename save flow.
- M3.97 completed and squash-merged as PR #112 at `3bca10042a369191a14e441acabc891a21a09135`.
- Awaiting local validation of M3.98.
- PR #76 remains parked; PR #22 remains unrelated and untouched.

## Workflow for next chat

- Inspect actual `main` SHA, branch state, and open PRs before acting.
- M3.98 is the active milestone; do not assume local validation has passed.
- When user reports `PASS` / `pass` / `lanjutkan`, mark the active Draft PR ready, squash-merge it using the verified head SHA, record the actual merge SHA, reconcile all three docs, verify `main`, then audit and start the next focused milestone.
- Never claim lint/test/build/cargo/manual validation passed unless the user explicitly confirms it.
